        "brochure": "  Title: Cosentyx: A Life-Changing Solution for Moderate to Severe Psoriasis in Korea\nSubtitle: Real-World Study Shows Sustained Efficacy and Safety in Patients with Psoriasis\n[Introduction]\nAre you tired of managing moderate to severe psoriasis? A new treatment option may be just what you need to take control of your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Cosentyx, an interleukin-17A (IL-17A) inhibitor, has been shown to be highly effective and safe in treating patients with psoriasis in Korea. In this brochure, we will explore the key findings of a real-world, non-interventional study that evaluated the safety and effectiveness of Cosentyx in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.\n[Section 1: Effectiveness]\nCosentyx has been shown to be highly effective in reducing psoriasis symptoms in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. In the study, the absolute Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score decreased from 16.1 to 1.6 at week 24, indicating significant improvement in symptoms. Additionally, the percentage of patients achieving PASI 75/90/100 was high, with 95.1%, 62.4%, and 24.9% of patients achieving these targets, respectively. These results suggest that Cosentyx is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis in Korea.\n[Section 2: Safety]\nCosentyx was generally well-tolerated in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, with adverse events (AEs) occurring in 29.0% of patients, treatment-related AEs in 9.5% of patients, and serious AEs in 4.1% of patients. The most common AEs were mild to moderate in severity and included nasopharyngitis, headache, and upper respiratory tract infection. These results suggest that Cosentyx is a safe treatment option for patients with psoriasis in Korea.\n[Section 3: Demographics]\nThe study included 829 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, with a median age of 54 years. Male patients made up 65% of the study population. These demographics highlight the diversity of patients with psoriasis in Korea who may benefit from Cosentyx treatment.\n[Section 4: Comorbidities]\nPatients with moderate to severe psoriasis in the study had a high prevalence of comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease (21.7%), diabetes (12.3%), and obesity (31.7%). These comorbidities highlight the importance of treating psoriasis effectively to improve overall health and quality of life.\n[Section 5: Treatment Response]\nThe study found that patients who were biologic-na\u00efve had a similar treatment response to secukinumab as those who were biologic-experienced. This suggests that Cosentyx may be effective in patients who have previously received other biologic treatments for psoriasis. This is important for patients who may have had limited success with other treatments or who may be looking for a new treatment option.\n[Section 6: Quality of Life]\nThe study found that patients with moderate to severe psoriasis experienced significant improvements in quality of life measures, including symptoms and perceptions, activities of daily living, and discomfort caused by treatment. These improvements suggest that Cosentyx can have a positive impact on patients' overall quality of life beyond just reducing their psoriasis symptoms.\n[Conclusion]\nCosentyx is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis in Korea. The study showed that Cosentyx was well-tolerated and resulted in significant improvements in psoriasis symptoms, quality of life measures, and comorbidities. If you are living with moderate to severe psoriasis in Korea, Cosentyx may be the life-changing solution you need to take control of your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Consult with your healthcare provider to determine if Cosentyx is right for you.",

This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of podocyte and epidermal cell injury in psoriasis and evaluate the therapeutic effect of Cosentyx.\nA psoriasis-like mouse model was established using BALB/C mice, and Cosentyx treatment was administered via intraperitoneal injection. Various parameters, including skin lesions, urinary protein, kidney/serum inflammatory cytokines, kidney function, podocyte membrane proteins, and Toll-like receptors/nuclear factor kappa-b (TLR/NF-\u03baB) pathway-associated proteins, were analyzed to explore the mechanisms of podocyte and epidermal cell injury in psoriasis and the potential ameliorative effects of Cosentyx.\nTreatment with Cosentyx significantly reduced the increased levels of urinary protein, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen caused by psoriasis. Cosentyx inhibited the upregulation of kidney/serum inflammatory factors (IL-17, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-22) and TLR/NF-\u03baB-related proteins (TLR2, TLR4, MyD88, and NF-\u03baBp65) in both psoriatic skin and kidney tissues, while also reducing the accumulation of oxidative products. Moreover, Cosentyx treatment suppressed podocyte apoptosis and promoted epidermal cell apoptosis. The experimental data demonstrated that psoriasis-like inflammation impaired renal podocytes through the TLR/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.\nCosentyx treatment effectively inhibited the expression of TLR/NF-\u03baB-related proteins, providing a therapeutic effect for psoriasis-induced kidney and skin injuries."

        "brochure": "  Marketing Brochure for Cosentyx (Secukinumab) for Medical Doctors:\nIntroduction:\nCosentyx (secukinumab) is a biologic treatment for psoriasis that can provide effective and early relief for patients suffering from this chronic skin condition. The following articles provide valuable insights into the benefits of Cosentyx in treating psoriasis, including early response to treatment, predicting early response to therapy, exacerbation of psoriasis following COVID-19 infection, and the protective role of biological agents.\nEarly Response to Treatment with Cosentyx:\nThe study found that patients who achieved a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) of 2 or less six months after initiating therapy with Cosentyx had more stable psoriasis and a lower risk of flares and treatment discontinuation. This suggests that Cosentyx can provide effective relief for psoriasis patients early on in treatment.\nPredicting Early Response to Secukinumab Therapy:\nThe study identified that baseline monocyte counts were significantly correlated with PASI before and six months after initiating Cosentyx therapy. A lower monocyte count with a cutoff value of less than 0.69 x 103/microL was found to be an independent factor for achieving PASI 2 or less six months after initiation of therapy with Cosentyx. This suggests that measuring monocyte counts before starting treatment can help predict the likelihood of achieving early response to Cosentyx therapy.\nExacerbation of Psoriasis Following COVID-19 Infection:\nThe study investigated the exacerbation of psoriasis in psoriatic patients with COVID-19 following treatment with three different biologics, adalimumab, secukinumab, and ixekizumab. The results showed that the severity of psoriasis can worsen after COVID-19 infection, and a smaller proportion of patients taking biologics developed worsening psoriasis compared to those not using biologics. However, only the patients taking ixekizumab demonstrated a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). This suggests that biological agents like Cosentyx may play a protective role in preventing worsening psoriasis symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nProtective Role of Biological Agents:\nThe study proposed that psoriatic patients treated with biologics should continue with the treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic to protect against worsening psoriasis symptoms. This suggests that biological agents like Cosentyx may be beneficial in maintaining stable psoriasis symptoms during the pandemic.\nConclusion:\nCosentyx (secukinumab) is a biologic treatment for psoriasis that can provide effective and early relief for patients suffering from this chronic skin condition. The articles suggest that Cosentyx can provide effective relief for psoriasis patients early on in treatment, predict the likelihood of achieving early response to therapy, and play a protective role in preventing worsening psoriasis symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a medical doctor, you can confidently recommend Cosentyx to your patients for effective and sustainable relief from psoriasis symptoms.",

This study aimed to identify markers that can predict early response to treatment with secukinumab in patients with plaque psoriasis. Treatment with secukinumab was initiated in 29 biologic-naive patients with plaque psoriasis (75.9% males). After six months, the patients were stratified as (1) PASI 2 or less responders or (2) PASI greater than 2 responders. Patients who achieved PASI 2 or less six months after initiation of secukinumab therapy already had significantly greater PASI reductions after the first month of therapy compared to those with PASI greater than 2 six months after treatment. Baseline blood monocyte counts significantly correlated with PASI, both before and six months after initiating secukinumab therapy. A lower monocyte count with a cutoff value set at less than 0.69 &times; 103/microL (based on ROC curve analysis) was found in multivariate analysis to be an independent factor for achieving PASI 2 or less six months after initiation of therapy with secukinumab (R2 = 0.7; beta = -0.67; P = 0.03). We showed that baseline monocyte count may be useful for predicting early response to secukinumab therapy in plaque psoriasis patients. Identifying such a marker may help clinicians choose the most appropriate biologics for patients with plaque psoriasis and help avoid the expense of switching from one biologic to another.

After abandoning 'zero COVID' strategies, China experienced a surge of Omicron infections.\nWe aimed to investigate psoriasis exacerbation in psoriatic patients with COVID-19, following treatment with three different biologics, adalimumab, secukinumab, and ixekizumab.\nWe performed a prospective study (n\u00a0=\u00a0209) at our hospital between November 01, 2022, and February 15, 2023. We defined \u25b3 PASI as post-COVID-19 PASI minus pre-COVID-19 PASI. Two endpoints were set in this study. \u25b3 PASI >0 was defined as exacerbation of psoriasis after infection. \u25b3 PASI >3 was defined as a severe exacerbation of psoriasis symptoms after infection. In addition, serum OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 were also assessed.\nResults showed that the severity of psoriasis can worsen after COVID-19 infection, and a smaller proportion of patients taking biologics developed worsening psoriasis compared to those not using biologics; however, only the patients taking ixekizumab demonstrated a statistically significant difference (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while those taking adalimumab or secukinumab didn't. What's more, the use of biological agents suppressed the serum OAS2 and OAS3 at low levels and elevated the serum OAS1 level in patients with psoriasis.\nThis study provided new insights into the protective role of biological agents in patients with psoriasis who were infected with COVID-19, and we proposed that psoriatic patients treated with biologics should continue with the treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic."
