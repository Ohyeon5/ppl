The most affected health dimensions were symptoms and perceptions (57.5%), activities of daily living (27.5%) and discomfort caused with treatment (17.5%). No association was found between DLQI score < 1 and demographic, comorbidities and treatment-related variables. The median PASI reduction in patients with DLQI<1 was superior to patients with DLQI > 1 (100% vs 90.2%, p=0.025).\nPatients with moderate/severe plaque psoriasis treated with interleukin 17 or 23 inhibitors achieve adequate therapeutic targets achieving the target set according to clinical practice guideline recommendations (score \u22641 on the DLQI questionnaire and 90-100% reduction in the PASI index) and in accordance with the results of recent meta-analyses and real-life studies. A greater reduction of the PASI index is observed in the group reaching the quality of life target, there being the possibility of using patient-reported outcomes in the evaluation of treatment effectiveness."

However, anti-IL-17A small molecule treatments are yet to be commercialized. Celastrol, a natural compound extracted from the roots of traditional Chinese medicinal plants, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the binding of celastrol to IL-17A and the associated anti-inflammatory mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated whether celastrol could directly bind to IL-17A and regulate inflammation in psoriatic in vitro and in vivo models. The results showed that celastrol directly binds to IL-17A and inhibits its downstream signaling, including the NF-kB and MAPK pathways. Interestingly, celastrol restored autophagy dysfunction and reduced proinflammatory cytokine secretion in keratinocytes. In addition, celastrol increased autophagy in the epidermis of a mouse model of psoriasis. Celastrol decreased Th17 cell populations and proinflammatory cytokine levels in mice. Thus, IL-17A-targeting celastrol reduced inflammation by rescuing impaired autophagy in in vitro and in vivo models of psoriasis, demonstrating its potential as a substitute for anti-IL-17A antibodies for treating psoriasis."

Treatment with secukinumab was initiated in 29 biologic-naive patients with plaque psoriasis (75.9% males). After six months, the patients were stratified as (1) PASI 2 or less responders or (2) PASI greater than 2 responders. Patients who achieved PASI 2 or less six months after initiation of secukinumab therapy already had significantly greater PASI reductions after the first month of therapy compared to those with PASI greater than 2 six months after treatment. Baseline blood monocyte counts significantly correlated with PASI, both before and six months after initiating secukinumab therapy. A lower monocyte count with a cutoff value set at less than 0.69 &times; 103/microL (based on ROC curve analysis) was found in multivariate analysis to be an independent factor for achieving PASI 2 or less six months after initiation of therapy with secukinumab (R2 = 0.7; beta = -0.67; P = 0.03). We showed that baseline monocyte count may be useful for predicting early response to secukinumab therapy in plaque psoriasis patients.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved nine biologic agents to address the burden of psoriasis, but their cardiovascular risks remain poorly studied.\nThis retrospective pharmacovigilance study utilized the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to analyze adverse events associated with newly approved therapeutic agents for psoriasis. We employed disproportionally signal analysis, calculating the reporting odds ratio (ROR) with a 95% confidence interval.\nAmong the vast FAERS database, which contained >25 million adverse events, a total of 334,399 events were associated with newly approved therapeutic agents for psoriasis. Cardiac adverse events accounted for 3852 cases, including pericarditis, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. Secukinumab had the highest number of reported adverse events, followed by brodalumab, while tildrakizumab had the lowest. Coronary artery disease was the most reported adverse event (1438 cases), followed by pericarditis (572 cases) and atrial fibrillation (384 cases). Secukinumab had the highest incidence of coronary artery disease, pericarditis, and atrial fibrillation. Risankizumab was significantly associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, while tildrakizumab and Ixekizumab were associated with atrial fibrillation. Secukinumab was associated with an elevated risk of pericarditis.\nThe study uncovers the cardiovascular adverse effects related to biologic agents used in psoriasis treatment. These findings emphasize the importance of monitoring and evaluating the cardiovascular safety profiles of biological agents used in psoriasis treatment."

Additionally, rhabdoid tumor cell line A-204 and Ewings sarcoma cell line A-673 were cultured to assess the in vitro effect of everolimus. Furthermore, the cell-derived xenograft (CDX) of A-673 was established and treated with everolimus in vivo. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were performed to detect the expressions of pertinent proteins. Results showed that everolimus intervention had limited inhibitory effect on PDX tumor growth compared to cyclophosphamide. Nevertheless, everolimus treatment significantly influenced the phosphorylation levels of S6 kinase beta 1 (S6K1) and eIF4E-binding protein 1 (p-4E-BP1), resulting in the inhibition of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, everolimus led to an up-regulation in the level of interleukin (IL)-17A in sarcoma cells. Notably, when secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody of IL-17A, was combined with everolimus, it synergistically enhanced the inhibitory effect of everolimus on sarcoma cell proliferation in vitro and on the growth of PDX or CDX xenograft tumors in vivo. Importantly, this combination therapy did not affect the mTOR signaling. These results indicate that everolimus exerts an anti-pediatric sarcomas effect by inhibiting mTOR signal. However, everolimus induces sarcoma cells to produce IL-17A, which promotes tumor cell survival and counteracts its anti-pediatric sarcomas effect. The combination of secukinumab effectively eliminates the effects of IL-17A, thereby improving the therapeutic efficacy of everolimus in the context of pediatric sarcomas."

RDGP transcripts of histological responders only partially overlapped between Week 12 and 52, despite similar number of transcripts in each RDGP; specifically, four novel transcript subsets showed distinct expression dynamics between Week 12 and 52 (slow-resolving, recurring, persistent, and resolved), with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory genes (e.g., SOCS1, CD207, IL-37) notably restored at Week 52. Shorter disease duration prior to secukinumab treatment coincided with greater transcript improvements at Week 12 and Week 52.\nSecukinumab improves the histological and molecular phenotype of psoriatic lesional skin up to 52 weeks of treatment; these results suggest possible mechanisms that drive long-term control of psoriasis."

Here, we report a clinical case of a 56-year-old woman with a 44-year history of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis under treatment with an anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha biosimilar (adalimumab) with good control of skin disease and without rheumatic involvement to date who came to us with complaints of migratory polyarthralgia starting one week after receiving the second dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. The condition progressed over the following months and a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis was established. Biologic treatment was switched to an anti-interleukin 17A (secukinumab), with a very good clinical cutaneous and articular response, which was sustained up to the present moment. The mechanisms behind the exacerbation or new-onset of autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases after receiving anti-COVID-19 vaccines are not yet fully understood, requiring further investigation. It is also not known whether rheumatic symptoms post-COVID-19 infection will have similar mechanisms to rheumatic symptoms post-anti-COVID-19 vaccination. With the continuing worldwide vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, clinicians need to be prepared to discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination and should be aware that it may cause or exacerbate immune disorders such as psoriatic arthritis, warranting close follow-up in terms of disease progression and treatment."

        "abstract": "Glucocorticoids (GC) are the standard treatment for giant cell arteritis (GCA), even though they are associated with adverse side effects and high relapse rates. Tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, has shown promise in sustaining remission and reducing the cumulative GC dosage, but it increases the risk of infections and is expensive. After discontinuation of TCZ, only about half of patients remain in remission. Additionally, only few studies have been conducted looking at remission maintenance, highlighting the need for alternative strategies to maintain remission in GCA. Methotrexate (MTX) has been shown to significantly decrease the risk of relapse in new-onset GCA and is already a proven safe drug in many rheumatologic diseases.\nThis study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MTX in maintaining remission in patients with GCA who have previously been treated with GC and at least 6\u00a0months with TCZ. We hypothesize that MTX can maintain remission in GCA patients, who have achieved stable remission after treatment with GC and TCZ, and prevent the occurrence of relapses. The study design is a monocentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase II trial randomizing 40 GCA patients 1:1 into a MTX or placebo arm. Patients will receive 17.5\u00a0mg MTX/matching placebo weekly by subcutaneous injection for 12\u00a0months, with the possibility of dose reduction if clinically needed. A 6-month follow-up will take place. The primary endpoint is the time to first relapse in the MTX group versus placebo during the 12-month treatment period. Secondary outcomes include patient- and investigator-reported outcomes and laboratory findings, as well as the prevalence of aortitis, number of vasculitic vessels, and change in intima-media thickness during the study.\nThis is the first clinical trial evaluating remission maintenance of GCA with MTX after a previous treatment cycle with TCZ. Following the discontinuation of TCZ in GCA, MTX could be a safe and inexpensive drug.\nClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05623592. Registered on 21 November 2022.

        "abstract": "Background Measuring disease activity in psoriatic arthritis using validated tools and treating to a target (T2T) is advocated. It improves quality of life and delays radiographic progression. In clinical practice, it guides therapy escalation to achieve better disease control. This study aimed to assess the real-life implementation of the T2T concept in daily clinical practice and the proportion of patients achieving the target of low disease activity or remission. Methodology In this study, a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis having clinical visits from January 2020 to February 2023 was done. The proportion of patients in whom disease activity was monitored using the Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) 28 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) and those achieving the target was calculated using SPSS version 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results A total of 89 patients were included in the study after fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Overall, 56.2% (50) of patients were males and 43.8% (39) were females, with a mean age of 43.5 \u00b1 14.5 years, mean disease duration of 6.6 \u00b1 3.8 years, and mean follow-up duration of 2.8 \u00b1 1.6 years. Of the study population, 43.8% (39) had axial involvement, 23.6% (21) had dactylitis, and 12.4% (11) had enthesitis. Skin psoriasis was present in 84.3% (75), 11.2% (10) had a family history of psoriasis, 19.1% (17) had nail changes, 1.1% (1) had uveitis, and in 94.8% (73) of patients skin psoriasis presented before arthritis. Overall, 97.7% (85) of patients were on conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), with the most common being methotrexate in 77%, followed by leflunomide in 8%. Further, 34.8% (31) were using biological DMARDs (bDMARDs), with the most common being tofacitinib (33.7%), infliximab (28.1%), and secukinumab (24.7%) being other choices. Overall, 21.1% (18) of patients experienced adverse events with csDMARDs and 3.2% (1) with biological DMARDs. DAPSA28 was recorded in 44.9% (40), Psoriasis Area and Severity Index in 16.8% (15), and PGA in 100% of patients. Target of low disease activity (LDA)/remission was achieved in 50.6% (45) patients, as assessed by PGA or DAPSA28 cutoff. The LDA/remission target was achieved in 51.2% of patients taking csDMARDs, and 74.2% in those who were on bDMARDs. Conclusions It is crucial to measure the disease activity using validated tools and treat the patient to target for achieving better disease control and improved quality of life. Despite the evidence that T2T improves outcomes, it is not widely practiced in routine clinical practice."

        "abstract": "Secukinumab is an anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody approved for treating psoriasis and various arthritides. A comprehensive evaluation of its safety, especially in a real-world setting, is necessary. This study aimed to describe the adverse events (AE) associated with secukinumab use using the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. FAERS data files containing AE reports from 2015 to 2021 were downloaded for data mining. Primary or secondary suspect medications indicated for psoriasis were identified and analyzed. Medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA version 24.1) was used to analyze the AE terms. To detect potential safety signals of AE from secukinumab use, disproportionality analysis was used. A total of 365,590 adverse event reports were identified; of these, 44,761 reports involved the use of secukinumab. Safety signals were identified for ocular infections and gastrointestinal adverse events at the standardised MedDRA query level. Safety signals for oral candidiasis, oral herpes, conjunctivitis, eye infections, and ulcerative colitis were identified at the preferred term level. The findings of our study are consistent with those of earlier studies, such as the increased risk of infections and inflammatory bowel disease. However, our study also identified additional safety signals that need to be further evaluated."

        "abstract": "Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a potentially life-threatening skin disease. Although several medications are approved for treating GPP in Japan, there are limited data on real-world treatment patterns or drug survival (the number of prescribed days of treatment). This retrospective cohort study describes drug survival and treatment patterns of patients with newly diagnosed GPP (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision code L40.1), and\u2009\u22651\u2009year of follow-up, using de-identified claims data (Medical Data Vision Co., Ltd.) from January 2016 to August 2021. Most (97.0%) of the 434 Japanese patients received first-line therapy of etretinate (26.4%), topical medications (14.7%), or cyclosporin (14.3%); 80.0% and 60.1% of patients received a second and third line of therapy (LOT), respectively. Use of etretinate (12.6%) and cyclosporin (5.9%) decreased in second-line therapies, whereas use of biologics (interleukin [IL]-17, 14.3%; IL-23 inhibitors, 7.6%) and topical medications (22.1%) increased or remained consistent. Approximately 50% of biologics were prescribed in combination with systemic medications or systemic corticosteroids. Median (range) time to next therapy (TTNT) was 2.8\u2009(0.03-48.07) months for first-line therapy and 3.3\u2009(0.03-52.97) months for all other LOTs. TTNT was longer for combination therapies (up to 16.5\u2009months) compared with monotherapies (up to 7.5\u2009months). Biologics exhibited longer drug survival with fewer treatment episodes compared with non-biologic systemic medications. Among frequently used therapies, the median (95% confidence interval) drug survival was 8.8 (5.8-11.8) months for etretinate, 4.3 (2.2-6.9) months for systemic corticosteroids, and 19.6 (16.1-26.7) months for secukinumab. Treatment patterns varied considerably, highlighting the need for treatment algorithms and effective, well-tolerated medications to support patients to help them remain on long-term therapy."
