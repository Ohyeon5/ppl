Here are some key points from the study:\n1. Effectiveness: The study found that secukinumab was effective in reducing psoriasis symptoms in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. At week 24, the absolute Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score decreased from 16.1 to 1.6, indicating significant improvement in symptoms. Additionally, the percentage of patients achieving PASI 75/90/100 was high, with 95.1%, 62.4%, and 24.9% of patients achieving these targets, respectively.\n2. Safety: The study found that secukinumab was generally well-tolerated, with adverse events (AEs) occurring in 29.0% of patients, treatment-related AEs in 9.5% of patients, and serious AEs in 4.1% of patients. The most common AEs were mild to moderate in severity and included nasopharyngitis, headache, and upper respiratory tract infection.\n3. Demographics: The study included 829 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, with a median age of 54 years. Male patients made up 65% of the study population.\n4. Comorbidities: The study found that patients with moderate to severe psoriasis had a high prevalence of comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease (21.7%), diabetes (12.3%), and obesity (31.7%).\n5. Treatment response: The study found that patients who were biologic-na\u00efve had a similar treatment response to secukinumab as those who were biologic-experienced. This suggests that secukinumab may be effective in patients who have previously received other biologic treatments for psoriasis.\n6. Quality of life: The study found that patients with moderate to severe psoriasis experienced significant improvements in quality of life measures, including symptoms and perceptions, activities of daily living, and discomfort caused by treatment.\nOverall, the study suggests that secukinumab is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis in Korea, with a high rate of treatment response and low incidence of serious adverse events.",

        "response": "  Cosentyx is a medication that has been shown to be effective in reducing inflammation in patients with psoriasis, including those with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The medication works by inhibiting the activity of certain immune cells, including type 17 helper T cells and CD8+ T cells, which are involved in the inflammation that occurs in psoriasis.\nStudies have shown that early intervention is crucial for patients with psoriasis who are at high risk of developing PsA, as subclinical cutaneous inflammation may persist even after treatment. The specific mechanism of podocyte injury in psoriasis is still unclear, but research has shown an association between psoriasis and renal podocyite injury. There are currently no effective treatments available for this condition.\nCosentyx has been shown to reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17 and IL-23, in the skin and kidneys of patients with psoriasis. The medication also inhibits the upregulation of TLR/NF-\u03baB-related proteins in both psoriatic skin and kidney tissues, which can contribute to the development of psoriasis-induced kidney injuries. Additionally, Cosentyx treatment has been shown to reduce podocyte apoptosis and promote epidermal cell apoptosis, which can also contribute to the therapeutic effect of the medication.\nOverall, the benefits of Cosentyx in treating psoriasis include:\n1. Reduced inflammation: Cosentyx can reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the skin and kidneys of patients with psoriasis, which can help to alleviate symptoms such as itching and redness.\n2. Improved kidney function: By inhibiting the upregulation of TLR/NF-\u03baB-related proteins in the kidneys, Cosentyx can help to improve kidney function in patients with psoriasis-induced kidney injuries.\n3. Reduced risk of complications: By reducing inflammation and improving kidney function, Cosentyx can help to reduce the risk of complications associated with psoriasis, such as psoriatic arthritis and kidney disease.\n4. Improved quality of life: By alleviating symptoms and improving kidney function, Cosentyx can help to improve the overall quality of life for patients with psoriasis.",

This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of podocyte and epidermal cell injury in psoriasis and evaluate the therapeutic effect of Cosentyx.\nA psoriasis-like mouse model was established using BALB/C mice, and Cosentyx treatment was administered via intraperitoneal injection. Various parameters, including skin lesions, urinary protein, kidney/serum inflammatory cytokines, kidney function, podocyte membrane proteins, and Toll-like receptors/nuclear factor kappa-b (TLR/NF-\u03baB) pathway-associated proteins, were analyzed to explore the mechanisms of podocyte and epidermal cell injury in psoriasis and the potential ameliorative effects of Cosentyx.\nTreatment with Cosentyx significantly reduced the increased levels of urinary protein, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen caused by psoriasis. Cosentyx inhibited the upregulation of kidney/serum inflammatory factors (IL-17, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-22) and TLR/NF-\u03baB-related proteins (TLR2, TLR4, MyD88, and NF-\u03baBp65) in both psoriatic skin and kidney tissues, while also reducing the accumulation of oxidative products.

Predicting early response to secukinumab therapy: The study identified that baseline monocyte counts were significantly correlated with PASI before and six months after initiating secukinumab therapy. A lower monocyte count with a cutoff value of less than 0.69 x 103/microL was found to be an independent factor for achieving PASI 2 or less six months after initiation of therapy with secukinumab.\n3. Exacerbation of psoriasis following COVID-19 infection: The study investigated the exacerbation of psoriasis in psoriatic patients with COVID-19 following treatment with three different biologics, adalimumab, secukinumab, and ixekizumab. The results showed that the severity of psoriasis can worsen after COVID-19 infection, and a smaller proportion of patients taking biologics developed worsening psoriasis compared to those not using biologics. However, only the patients taking ixekizumab demonstrated a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05).\n4. Protective role of biological agents: The study proposed that psoriatic patients treated with biologics should continue with the treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic to protect against worsening psoriasis symptoms.\nOverall, the articles suggest that Cosentyx (secukinumab) can provide effective and early relief for psoriasis patients, and that biological agents may play a protective role in preventing worsening psoriasis symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

This study aimed to identify markers that can predict early response to treatment with secukinumab in patients with plaque psoriasis. Treatment with secukinumab was initiated in 29 biologic-naive patients with plaque psoriasis (75.9% males). After six months, the patients were stratified as (1) PASI 2 or less responders or (2) PASI greater than 2 responders. Patients who achieved PASI 2 or less six months after initiation of secukinumab therapy already had significantly greater PASI reductions after the first month of therapy compared to those with PASI greater than 2 six months after treatment. Baseline blood monocyte counts significantly correlated with PASI, both before and six months after initiating secukinumab therapy. A lower monocyte count with a cutoff value set at less than 0.69 &times; 103/microL (based on ROC curve analysis) was found in multivariate analysis to be an independent factor for achieving PASI 2 or less six months after initiation of therapy with secukinumab (R2 = 0.7; beta = -0.67; P = 0.03). We showed that baseline monocyte count may be useful for predicting early response to secukinumab therapy in plaque psoriasis patients. Identifying such a marker may help clinicians choose the most appropriate biologics for patients with plaque psoriasis and help avoid the expense of switching from one biologic to another.

After abandoning 'zero COVID' strategies, China experienced a surge of Omicron infections.\nWe aimed to investigate psoriasis exacerbation in psoriatic patients with COVID-19, following treatment with three different biologics, adalimumab, secukinumab, and ixekizumab.\nWe performed a prospective study (n\u00a0=\u00a0209) at our hospital between November 01, 2022, and February 15, 2023. We defined \u25b3 PASI as post-COVID-19 PASI minus pre-COVID-19 PASI. Two endpoints were set in this study. \u25b3 PASI >0 was defined as exacerbation of psoriasis after infection. \u25b3 PASI >3 was defined as a severe exacerbation of psoriasis symptoms after infection. In addition, serum OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 were also assessed.\nResults showed that the severity of psoriasis can worsen after COVID-19 infection, and a smaller proportion of patients taking biologics developed worsening psoriasis compared to those not using biologics; however, only the patients taking ixekizumab demonstrated a statistically significant difference (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while those taking adalimumab or secukinumab didn't. What's more, the use of biological agents suppressed the serum OAS2 and OAS3 at low levels and elevated the serum OAS1 level in patients with psoriasis.\nThis study provided new insights into the protective role of biological agents in patients with psoriasis who were infected with COVID-19, and we proposed that psoriatic patients treated with biologics should continue with the treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic."
